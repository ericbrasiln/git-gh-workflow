"Open online learning communities are susceptible to gender barriers if not carefully  constructed. Gender barriers were identified in The Programming Historian, through an  open online discussion, which informed an anonymous user survey. The initial discussion  pointed towards two barriers in particular: a technically challenging submission system and  open peer review, as factors that needed consideration. Findings are put in context of the  literature on gender and online communication, abuse, and online learning communities.  The evidence suggests that open online learning communities such as The Programming  Historian should work actively to promote a civil environment, and should listen to their  communities about technical and social barriers to participation. Whenever possible,  barriers should be removed entirely, but when that is not feasible due to financial or  technical constraints, alternatives should be offered.

ProgHist","While all work is thoroughly reviewed, the editorial policy is  always to work closely with authors to improve the work until it is publishable. This is  distinct from the editor-as-gatekeeper model, and instead provides mentoring as needed. In  this regard, the editorial board views The Programming Historian as both a scholarly  publication and an open online learning community.
ProgHist","Desde agosto de 2016, el equipo editorial  de contenidos en español de PH comenzó el proceso de  traducción de los más de 50 tutoriales publicados en el  portal del proyecto en inglés. Al la fecha se han traducido  alrededor de 30 tutoriales a partir de la participación de  alrededor de 15 colaboradores de países como Argentina,  España, Colombia y México.
ProgHist","Until November 2015, the editorial board believed that the community was gender neutral,  as the team had not consciously constructed gender barriers. However, a self-assessment  revealed a different picture. Since launching in July 2012, the project had published 45  tutorials by 30 different authors. Of those, only seven authors (23%) were women. 
ProgHist","Our technical team has poured labor into creating metadata validation systems that would  have otherwise come built-in with a database-backed CMS. As our team, metadata richness, and pace of  publication expanded, metadata errors increased in frequency. And with a larger team, it was less likely that any  given editor would be completely familiar with how the data they entered was used by the site, making it more likely  that multiple editors would need to be pulled into a troubleshooting conversation.
ProgHist","PH representa un proyecto colabo- rativo de servicio académico voluntario, que se sostiene  en la conformación de redes globales de conocimiento  abierto. El proyecto ha enfrentado los retos que suponen  encontrar voluntarios que quieran revisar, traducir y crear  tutoriales del inglés al español. Lo anterior, teniendo en  cuenta la falta de reconocimiento y validez académica  dada la carencia de mecanismos de evaluación de pro- ductos de investigación digital (Galina Russell 2016). De  igual manera, ha resultado un reto garantizar la calidad  de los contenidos desde un punto de vista lingüístico.
ProgHist","PH, una publica- ción en línea de acceso abierto bilingüe, ha desarrollado  un modelo para afrontar el problema del acceso global y  lingüístico a recursos, metodologías y herramientas di- gitales para las humanidades. Este compromiso con la  diversidad lingüística y geográfica en las humanidades  digitales significa comprender los límites y posibilidades  de los contextos institucionales, históricos, culturales y  económicos en el mundo hispanoparlante.
ProgHist","Several beneficial aspects are connected to the journal’s  novice-friendly approach, including the inclusion of lessons  in several languages and the use of pedagogic reasoning. As  for the readability of articles, syntax highlighting assists the  reader in comprehending code-workflow and visualizations  the programs, markup  relate  languages and tools accounted for. The tutorials are assigned  difficulty level labels, ranging from low to high. These levels,  as well as particular topics, are filterable which eases the task  of accessing articles according to skill level and interest. The  tutorials with a low difficulty level are straightforward and  comprehensible, making them truly accessible for novices.
ProgHist","Openness is an important tenet adopted by many digital humanities projects. The  Programming Historian is an open-access publisher, requires tools and techniques to use  open access software whenever possible, and practices open peer review. This last policy  was adopted to promote civility in the peer review process. Many academics will have  experience with ad hominem reviewer comments from anonymous peer reviewers, and this  has led to a number of journals experimenting with open review to promote civility, as long  as the online learning community is well-policed by editors (Burge, 1998; Herring, 2000;  McSporran & Young, 2001; Browne, 2003; Rovai & Baker, 2005).  
ProgHist","The Programming Historian has no active budget, so uses free open tools to run the website  and message boards. At the time of the survey, potential contributors of a tutorial had to  write their submission in a format known as ‘markdown’, which uses symbols to denote  parts of the text. 
ProgHist","Sin embargo, los esfuerzos de  traducción son esenciales para impulsar una comuni- dad de práctica en el sur global.

"In this case study, we show how the challenges of maintaining a sustainable static-site architecture for the Programming Historian are deeply intertwined with the logistical challenges of expanding the original project into a multilingual set of publications. In our desire to democratize access to knowledge, we constantly encounter situations where easing the complexity of one workflow requires increasing the complexity of another, in turn relocating complexity (and the labor it entails) between different members of our project team.
