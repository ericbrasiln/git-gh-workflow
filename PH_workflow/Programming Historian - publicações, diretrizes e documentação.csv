Os diretórios centrais dessa análise são: `pt/`, `es/`, `en/`, `fr/` e `lesson/`.</p> <h2>Estrutura dos 4 diretórios dos idiomas</h2> <h3>Português</h3> <pre>pt ├── licoes │ &nbsp; ├── originaes │ &nbsp; ├── publicadas │ &nbsp; ├── traducoes │ &nbsp; ├── README.md │ ├── README.md</pre> <h4>Propostas</h4> <p>O diretório `pt/licoes/traducoes` possui oito diretórios de imagens de lições traduzidas. Essas imagens não deveriam estar localizadas aqui, mesmo se forem imagens novas produzidas para as traduções. Se essas imagens já foram inseridas nos diretório `programminghistorian/jekyll/images` elas devem ser excluídas.</p> <p>Por exemplo, o diretório `pt/licoes/traducoes/Sonificacap-dos-dados` possui imagens idênticas às da pasta `programminghistorian/jekyll/images/sonification`. E no arquivo md da lição em português, os links das imagens se referem às imagens originais em inglês. Ou seja, o diretório `pt/licoes/traducoes/Sonificacap-dos-dados` não deveria existir.</p> <p>O diretório `pt/licoes/publicadas` foi atualizado pela última vez 14 meses atrás. Portanto, muitas lições em português já publicadas não estão registradas ali.</p> <p>É importante atualizar o README.md da pasta de pt com o link para a página da equipe editorial e as urls como no padrão espanhol.</p> <p>Buscando padronizar os diretórios dos quatro idiomas, sugiro mover os diretórios `pt/licoes/originais`, `pt/licoes/publicadas` e `pt/licoes/traducoes` para o diretório `pt/`, e excluir o ficheiro `licoes/`. Também seria interessante incluir um ficheiro `lista-de-traducoes.md`.</p> <h3>Espanhol</h3> <pre>es ├── borradores │ &nbsp; ├── originales │ &nbsp; ├── traducciones │ ├── publicadas │ &nbsp; ├── originales │ &nbsp; ├── traducciones │ ├── README.md ├── lista-de-traducciones.md ├── PLANTILLA-LECCION.md ├── PLANTILLA-PROPUESTA-LECCION.md ├── PLANTILLA-TRADUCCION.md</pre> <h4>Propostas</h4> <p>Sugiro excluir os ficheiros `PLANTILLA...`, pois são modelos de criação de issues, que devem constar como issue templates (ver proposta de criação de templates de issues para vários idiomas).</p> <h3>Francês</h3> <pre>fr ├── documentation │ &nbsp; ├── gabarit-texte-relecture.md │ &nbsp; ├── liste-traductions.md │ ├── en-cours │ &nbsp; ├── originales │ &nbsp; ├── traductions │ ├── publiees │ &nbsp; ├── originales │ &nbsp; ├── traductions │ ├── README.md</pre> <h4>Propostas</h4> <p>Sugiro a exclusão do ficheiro `documentation/gabarit-texte-relecture.md`, pois deve estar inserido nos templates para issues (ver proposta de criação de templates de issues para vários idiomas).

Ahora bien, la traducción de material pedagógico (en concreto, tutoriales) sigue siendo un desafío, ya que no solo necesitan traducirse lingüísticamente, sino también adaptarse en contenido, a veces código y contexto. Basándonos en algunas nociones de la teoría de la traducción y en nuestra experiencia, en este artículo consideramos la forma de traducción finalista (Nord 2018) para metodologías digitales con el objetivo de generar un discurso crítico sobre los desafíos de traducir del inglés al español las lecciones de Programming Historian. Nuestra contribución defiende la necesidad de reflexionar sobre las epistemologías resultantes de las prácticas digitales y de reconocer cómo este desequilibrio condiciona el aprendizaje de habilidades digitales. Nuestro objetivo final es desarrollar una estrategia creativa que apoye el multiculturalismo y la diversidad en el campo de las humanidades digitales.","2021","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","2022-08-23 15:17:14","613-624","","4","104","","","¿Sin equivalencia?","","","","","","","Spanish","","","","","Project MUSE","","Publisher: Johns Hopkins University Press","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, archaeological curricula have not always followed suit, and many archaeologists are not up-to-date with the necessary digital skills. To fill this gap, online tutorials and learning platforms are being developed to familiarize archaeologists and students with the potential of digital media for archaeological research practices. Given the essential pedagogical role of these platforms, their quality is deserving of deeper interrogation. Here, I review three major platforms offering tutorials on digital archaeology: the Programming Historian, Project MERCURY-SIMREC, and the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook. These are evaluated and compared based on their goals, design (intuitiveness, ease of use), accessibility (use of jargon, required prerequisite knowledge, software requirements), scope (target audience, range of skills addressed, targeted level of improvement), and efficiency (whether or not they achieve their intended goals). The review concludes with a road map contextualizing the current state of available resources in light of the wider state of digital archaeology, and it considers pathways toward future development.","2020-02","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-08-23 15:06:08","87-92","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","digital resources; digital archaeology; online learning; tutorials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some scholars, leaning on the poles of digital history's “big tent” ethos, insist that learning to program is an unnecessary barrier to entry and rightly point out that one can do digital history without writing a single line of code. Yet the field also holds up coding as a gold standard, the pinnacle of technical achievement. One can easily find software and Web sites, as well as research in the field that used to be called humanities computing, to show how historians who program have influenced the profession. Such debates have a much broader context. Scientists, too, are sorting out how programming fits in their research and graduate programs. Learning to code is also an issue in K–12 education, with even President Barack Obama claiming that “everybody's got to learn how to code early” and backing it up by writing a few lines of JavaScript in the Oval Office. It is no surprise, then, that coding instruction has proliferated, with most of it aimed at the tech industry.","2016-06-01","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-08-23 15:09:02","299-301","","1","103","","Journal of American History","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The roles of these factors, along with their interrelationship and interaction, make student mobility a complex decision-making issue. Many textual data generated on social media can answer many open questions about factors affecting human behavior, particularly social mobility. We have developed a novel methodology, called Textual Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (TFISM), that automatically analyses large textual datasets to identify the internal and external relationships between management or decision-making problems. This computational social science methodology enhances Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approaches to allow the input to be textual data. It is multi-disciplinary and integrates ISM with Artificial Intelligence, Text extraction, and information retrieval techniques. TFISM is a domain-free method, while we have validated this methodology on two different datasets from social media and academic articles.

It uses data on personal (composer-to-composer) musical influences to generate and analyze network graphs. Data on style influences and composers ‘ecological’ data are then combined to composer-to-composer musical influences to build a similarity/distance matrix, and a multidimensional scaling analysis is used to locate the relative position of composers on a map while preserving the pairwise distances. Finally, a support-vector machines algorithm is used to generate classification maps. This article falls into the realm of an experiment in music education, not musicology. The ultimate objective is to explore parts of the classical music heritage and stimulate interest in discovering composers. In an age offering either inculcation through lists of prescribed composers and compositions to explore, or music recommendation algorithms that automatically propose works to listen to next, the analysis illustrates an alternative path that might promote the active rather than passive discovery of composers and their music in a less restrictive way than inculcation through prescription. © 2022, The Author(s).","2022","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","2277-2311","","5","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While previous research has mainly focused on activities at specific locations such as sport facilities, “informal sport” that occur at arbitrary locations across the city have been largely neglected. Such activities are more challenging to observe, but this challenge may be addressed using data collected from social media platforms, because social media users regularly generate content related to sports and exercise at given locations. This allows studying all sport, including those “informal sport” which are at arbitrary locations, to better understand sports and exercise-related activities in cities. However, user-generated geographical information available on social media platforms is becoming scarcer and coarser. This places increased emphasis on extracting location information from free-form text content on social media, which is complicated by multilingualism and informal language. To support this effort, this article presents an end-to-end deep learning-based bilingual toponym recognition model for extracting location information from social media content related to sports and exercise. We show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models. We further demonstrate how our model can be deployed in a geoparsing framework to support city planners in promoting healthy and active lifestyles. © Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License","2022","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","31-61","","24","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: University of Maine","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Popular verbal theories of the mechanisms underlying this decrement have primarily focused on inferred changes in associative memory. However, performance on any task is the result of interactions between different neurocognitive mechanisms, such as perceptuomotor, memory, and decision-making processes. As a result, age-related differences in performance could arise from multiple processes, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect conclusions about the sources of aging effects. In addition, standard statistical comparisons of group-level summary statistics, such as mean accuracy, may not provide sufficient information to allow detailed mechanistic explanations of age-related change. We argue that these and other drawbacks of relying exclusively on verbal theories can hamper replicability, transparency, and scientific progress in aging research and psychological science more generally, and that computational modeling is a tool that can address many of these limitations. Computational models make mathematically transparent claims about how latent processes give rise to observed behavior and decompose an individual’s performance into model parameters governing hypothesized mechanisms. In this work, we present a short memory task designed for and analyzed with mechanistic model-based approaches. We provide an example of a computational model and fit the model to data from young and older adults with hierarchical Bayesian techniques in order to (a) detect differences in latent cognitive processes between young and older adults (as well as individual participants), (b) quantitatively compare models to assess different processes that could underlie performance, and (c) simulate data to make predictions for future experiments based on model mechanisms. We argue that computational modeling is a powerful tool to examine age differences in latent processes, make theories more transparent, and facilitate discovery in cognitive aging research. © 2022 American Psychological Association","2022","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","10-29","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: American Psychological Association","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","Humans; Cognition; Aged; aged; aging; Aging; article; Bayes theorem; Bayes Theorem; cognition; cognitive aging; computer model; computer simulation; Computer Simulation; controlled study; decomposition; episodic memory; Geroscience; human; memory; prediction; quantitative analysis; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study employed a quasi-experimental design consisting of five groups as control classes and five groups as experimental classes. The subject of this study was 327 students (168 students used HOT Lab and 159 used Multiple Skill; 69 Male and 258 Female from 18 to 22 years old) with heterogeneous skills and learning habits from five different universities representing four regions: Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. The control class conducted activities based on the Higher-order Thinking Laboratory model, while the experimental class conducted activities based on the Multiple Skill Laboratory Activity Model. The data were collected by employing a validated instrument and were analyzed by employing a Multivariate test. This study shows that the experimental model has more significant influences on improving students’ skills than gender. Specifically, the Multiple Skill Laboratory Activity Model (MSLAM) improves students’ collaboration skills better than communication skills. MSLAM explores more activities to practice collaboration skills, e.g., brainstorming, exploration, and measurement, while the activities for practicing communication skills is depended on analysis and presenta-tion only. This study also reveals that the experiment model and gender are not suitable for concurrent analysis. This study is expected to provide methods for further researchers to optimize students’ scientific communication and collaboration skills. Furthermore, this study provides an overview for teachers to practice several thinking skills at one time. © 2021 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","2021","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","585-595","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Universitas Negeri Semarang","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, graduate students outside of these disciplines with an interest in the digital humanities must work within existing institutional structures and constraints to acquire the necessary training and methodological grounding that they need for their research. With these limitations in mind, in this paper I consider what it means to implement digital humanities approaches into graduate research in the variety of Modern Language departments that exist in the United States.

This research has two important threads that we hope will advance the archaeological study of landscapes. The first is the significant historical impact of charcoal production, a poorly understood industry of the late eighteenth to early twentieth century, on the historic and present landscape of the United States. Although this research focuses on charcoal production in Pennsylvania, it has broad application for both identifying and contextualizing historical charcoal production throughout the world and for better understanding modern charcoal production. The second thread is the use of open data, open source, and open access tools to conduct this analysis, as well as the open publication of the resultant data.

This article provides a survey of recent developments in digital art history from the perspective of European and North American publications and conferences. I discuss the digitization of visual, spatial, and textual resources by museums, research centers, and individual researchers. Researchers have developed a variety of tools for digitally analyzing art and architecture, which can replicate or challenge traditional methods of formal, iconographic, and socio-historical analysis. Trends in published research indicate uneven growth in the theoretical sophistication of digital art history scholarship. While digital methods are quickly moving into the training of art history professionals and students, digital art history communities in museums, research institutes, and universities remain somewhat fragmented.

In this sense, this research aims to examine the orientation of the anti-drug policy “Ruta Futuro” and the way it is perceived through written media. To do this, content analysis and text mining techniques are used to determine the positioning of the prohibitionist and comprehensive approaches in the fight against drugs in the public debate.

Using the Yellow River to illustrate the long-term effects of environmentally significant human activity, Ruth Mostern unravels the long history of the human relationship with water and soil and the consequences, at times disastrous, of ecological transformations that resulted from human decisions. As Mostern follows the Yellow River through three millennia of history, she underlines how governments consistently ignored the dynamic interrelationships of the river’s varied ecosystems—grasslands, riparian forests, wetlands, and deserts—and the ecological and cultural impacts of their policies. With an interdisciplinary approach informed by archival research and GIS (geographical information system) records, this groundbreaking volume provides unique insight into patterns, transformations, and devastating ruptures throughout ecological history and offers profound conclusions about the way we continue to affect the natural systems upon which we depend. © 2021 by Ruth Mostern.

While scholars have used the Natural History as an ad hoc source for investigations about specific aspects of scientific knowledge in the Roman Empire, it is much more difficult to define the broader models that unify the work’s disparate parts because of its size and scope. Quantitative and computational text technologies provide a methodology that help us understand the nature of this monumental compendium of scientific knowledge from the Roman Empire and allow us to answer specific questions such as the nature of sources that were used, the interrelations of the topics covered in the text, and the ways that these topics have been adopted or reflected in the publication history of the work. This paper explores the ways that other scholars and editors have tried to make this massive work more manageable, and then talk about the ways that network analysis and other quantitative approaches can help us understand the sources that Pliny used when writing his work. © 2021, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

Using four artificial intelligence algorithms, we estimated and classified the sentiments and emotions expressed in the texts; we also identified the themes that were mentioned by teachers with a qualitative methodology, thematic analysis. Findings showed that positive and neutral feelings towards the changes prevailed among teachers, and that comments were centered on facts more than opinions. The predominant emotion was confidence, followed by anticipation, joy and sadness. It was also evident that they envision technological changes in their teaching practice, but that they are also considering an impact on their pedagogy as well as in their attitudes towards education and life, and in their relationships with students. © 2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","144-150","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","Spanish","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 6th Latin American Conference on Learning Technologies, LACLO 2021 ; Conference Date: 19 October 2021 Through 21 October 2021; Conference Code:177612</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; Digital technologies; Sentiment analysis; Covid-19; Education teachers; Emergency remote teaching; High educations; Learn+; Remote teaching; Teachers'; Teaching practices; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second idea is to augment WSD results with crowd-sourcing solutions. The last idea seeks to reinforce students' learning by augmenting textual information with a visual aid, pictures related to the word, as part of the word lookup functionality.

By utilizing the wireless robot feature in collaboration with an AR camera, users can directly control the robot to be directed to that location. The research methodology used is thematic analysis with an approach through direct observation. The AR method used is marker-based which will be attached to each wall. The program will detect the marker and receive a receiving signal to display the available three-dimensional furniture oject. The existence of a marker can lock the object not to move from its coordinate point. The robot is driven through the remote control system by the Visual Studio application, which will be forwarded to the bluetooth, microcontroller, and motor driver. While the camera installed on top of the robot is controlled via the Unity app, users can adjust the location and position of three-dimensional furniture virtually through the Unity application.

Data visualization tools are one type of “middleware” that can be all but forgotten when one is presented with final products such as papers and presentations containing visualizations [Drucker and Svensson 2016]. Since the output of various software packages is sometimes similar, it is easy to forget the assumptions that went into the diagram, the dataset, and the software when looking at the final product — or even while using the tool if one becomes sufficiently accustomed to the interface. In this review, I revisit the visualization suite Palladio – which Miriam Posner has called a “Swiss Army knife for humanities data” [Posner 2014] – and the many projects that have made use of Palladio’s core features in the years since its launch. I examine the strengths and limitations of Palladio, as a network and map-making tool for exploring data and for rapidly prototyping diagrams, designed with an iterative process in mind. I contrast this iterative mentality with the analytic sensibility of tools like Gephi and Cytoscape, and review the primary features of Palladio with one primary case study (my own visualizations of the French Enlightenment network) and examples of how the features have been used in other digital humanities projects. Palladio is very useful for qualitative studies of data that include geospatial and chronological dimensions, especially when the data are tagged with different types of qualitative metadata, but it also tends to impose a historical geographical view on the data by foregrounding geospatial relationships, time, and other historical considerations. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

The objective of this article is to exemplify how we can use this tool for the exploration and analysis of scientific texts, discovering themes and associations between documents. 33 scientific documents that question and problematize the open access and open science movements are used as a corpus for analysis. Through different analytical and visualization tools, emerge terms (open source, APC, impact factor, prestige, exclusion, colonialism, coloniality) that as traces of ""breadcrumbs"" serve to make new explorations and visualizations that allow to identify authors, documents and problems related to open access and open science. It is concluded that Voyant Tools is a versatile and intuitive tool with various potentialities for the analysis and discovery of information in texts. Regarding the topic explored, criticisms and problematizations related to the emphasis on the market and capitalist acceleration behind open access and open science policies and initiatives are identified, with the rise of the commercial open access journals’ business model based on article processing charge (APC) and the appearance of new colonialism and epistemicide when open access, commodification of knowledge and distorted use of the impact factor are combined. © 2021, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

Central to the network has been the participation and experience of students, who have shared their digitally-focused work in a series of showcases and symposia that have alternated between SFU and UVic. What emerged during these events were student perspectives on current pedagogical practices in Digital Humanities, both inside and outside the classroom, as well as for the degree and beyond. Our special collection builds on these perspectives, featuring student authors addressing issues that over the past five years have been central to their DH learning and training. These student perspectives gather into four topic clusters, namely 1) Collaboration with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, & Museums (GLAM); 2) Digital Doctorates; 3) Major Research Projects; and 4) Transforming DH Pedagogy.

Runosong is an oral poetic tradition known among most of Finnic peoples. Estonian runosong texts, the material of the current research, have been collected mainly since 1880s and gathered into the Estonian Folklore Archives of the Estonian Literary Museum, where the runosong database with more than 100 000 texts has been compiled (Oras et al 2003–2020) Language of runosongs varies considerably across dialects and, in addition to that, it uses a specific archaic idiom different from the spoken language which complicates the computational analysis of the content aspects of the texts. Topic modelling is a method that enables to discover abstract topics detected statistically on the basis of the frequency of the co-occurrence of the words in the texts. In case of a runosong corpus, the method could be used to automatically detect the thematic structure of a large amount of runosong texts, to compare the thematic distribution of regional traditions of the runosong, and to analyse how the thematic distribution obtained with the help of computational methods relates to the classification of the texts resulting from folkloristic analysis. The idea of the current article is to explore whether topic modelling can give meaningful results if applied to unlemmatized and highly variative runosong texts. For LDA topic modelling I used the application MALLET (McCallum 2002). The initial trials with the whole corpus of runosong texts made it clear that the language of the songs is too variative to reach the level of content. It also became obvious that it is necessary to remove stopwords and refrain words. The topics, obtained from the runosongs from all over Estonia, represented dialectal variants of the language rather than thematic clusters and it was necessary to restrict the material. I used stylometric analysis (using R package stylo, Eder et al 2013) to divide the area into linguistically more homogenous subregions, and chose the area of Western islands of Estonia with 16 parishes and 3672 song texts for further explorations.With this material I decided to generate 20 topics. Within this smaller area the topics did not cluster regional language variants any more: (1) the linguistic variants of the main concepts of a topic were brought together under the keywords of the same topic; (2) in most cases, the detected topics were distributed among all the parishes included in the selection. Looking at the 20 keywords, the topics indeed seemed to reflect certain thematic subgroups of the songs. In several cases the most prominent song type of a topic was reflected in keywords, in other cases the keywords referred to larger groups of songs. Five of the 20 topics focused on weddings, more precisely, on different episodes of the wedding ritual: Adornation and dressing, arriving and greeting, finding the bride and taking her to her new home, sharing the presents prepared by the bride, and recommendations to the bride and the groom. In all these topics the verbs refer either to the present or the future (rather than to the past which is common in narrative songs). A topic of swinging songs includes also the songs about dancing and feasts. Five topics focus on different narrative plots about the troubles of young people, about wooing and marriage. Lyric songs about the life of orphans and about singing form a separate topic each, and there is a separate male topic covering the songs of various genres related to horses, riding and the woods. The largest topic includes the songs on working at home and outside, but also the songs about premarital sex. There are two topics with the focus on well-known children’s songs and lullabies. Two topics relate to German landlords, their power and activities, and one to recruiting and the war. As a conclusion of this exploration: (1) for topic modelling it is necessary to use the texts in homogenous language variants; otherwise, the linguistic differences override the topics at some point; (2) it is possible to use unlemmatized texts for topic modelling, but in this case the grammatical features (tense, modality) interfere with topic analysis; (3) the proportions of variable and stable (recurrent) elements (song types, motifs) in the material have a clear impact on topic formation: The more frequently an element occurs in the material, and the more stable is its wording, the bigger its probability to form the centre of a topic, whereas distinct but rare themes remain unnoticed and will be shared between the topics of more prominent subjects; (4) common sets of words assembled together as the topic may, in addition to the common thematic focus, refer to a common framework, for example environments, and behavioural or communicative patterns (for example, begging for something). Compared to the folkloristic classification of folk songs, the automatic distribution of songs (1) highlights the subjects occurring more frequently in the body of songs (for example, a topic highlights swinging songs instead of calendar songs of the folkloristic classification); (2) partly overrides the genre differences (for example song games can be found under different topics, whereas forming a distinct group in folkloristic classifications). © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

This paper aims to present a methodology for translating a hierarchy into a network structure using a number of methods for deriving statistical distributions from records metadata or content and then aggregating them. Simple similarity metrics are then used to compare and link, collections of records with similar characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The approach taken is to consider a record at any level of the catalogue hierarchy as a summary of its children. A distribution for each child record is created (e.g. word counts and date distribution) and averaged/summed with the other children. This process is repeated up the hierarchy to find a representative distribution of the whole series. By doing this the authors can compare record series together and create a similarity network. Findings: The summarising method was found to be applicable not only to a hierarchical catalogue but also to web archive data, which is by nature stored in a hierarchical folder structure. The case studies raised many questions worthy of further exploration such as how to present distributions and uncertainty to users and how to compare methods, which produce similarity scores on different scales. Originality/value: Although the techniques used to create distributions such as topic modelling and word frequency counts, are not new and have been used to compare documents, to the best of the knowledge applying the averaging approach to the archival catalogue is new. This provides an interesting method for zooming in and out of a collection, creating networks at different levels of granularity according to user needs. © 2020, Mark Bell.","2020","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","379-394","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, they influence the quality of recommendations. Specifically, in Visual Art (VA) recommendations the complexity of the concepts embodied within paintings, makes the task of capturing semantics by machines far from trivial. In VA recommendation, prominent works commonly use manually curated metadata to drive recommendations. Recent works in this domain aim at leveraging visual features extracted using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, such data representation approaches are resource demanding and do not have a direct interpretation, hindering user acceptance. To address these limitations, we introduce an approach for Personalised Recommendation of Visual arts based on learning latent semantic representation of paintings. Specifically, we trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on textual descriptions of paintings. Our LDA model manages to successfully uncover non-obvious semantic relationships between paintings whilst being able to offer explainable recommendations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method tends to perform better than exploiting visual features extracted using pre-trained Deep Neural Networks. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 15th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization, SMAP 2020 ; Conference Date: 29 October 2020 Through 30 October 2020; Conference Code:164932</p>","","","Neural networks; Semantics; Deep learning; Social networking (online); Latent dirichlet allocations; Statistics; Arts computing; Data representations; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Experimental evaluation; Latent semantics; Personalised recommendations; Quality of recommendations; Semantic relationships; Textual description; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. This article explores how this dramatic shift in our historical record changes the work of historians. It does so in two main ways. First, it outlines the approaches, methods, tools, and search functions that can help a historian turn web documents into historical sources. Secondly, it considers the implications of the size and scale of digital sources, which amount to more information than historians have ever had at their fingertips, and much of which are by and about people who have traditionally been absent from the historical record. As a way to make these points tangible, it does so primarily through an in-depth case study of working with the GeoCities. com web archive, a collection of hundreds of millions of 1990s webpages. © 2020 Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia, Instituto de Investigaciones y Formacion Avanzada.

Though initially applied exclusively in computer science, over time it has increasingly been adopted by many different application domains such as business, health and military. Contexts change continuously because of objective reasons, such as economic situation, political matter and social issues. The adoption of big data analytics by businesses is facilitating such change at an even faster rate in much complicated ways. The potential benefits of embedding contextual information into an application are already evidenced by the improved outcomes of the existing context-aware methods in those applications. Since big data is growing very rapidly, context awareness in big data analytics has become more important and timely because of its proven efficiency in big data understanding and preparation, contributing to extracting the more and accurate value of big data. Many surveys have been published on context-based methods such as context modelling and reasoning, workflow adaptations, computational intelligence techniques and mobile ubiquitous systems. However, to our knowledge, no survey of context-aware methods on big data analytics for business applications supported by enterprise level software has been published to date. To bridge this research gap, in this paper first, we present a definition of context, its modelling and evaluation techniques, and highlight the importance of contextual information for big data analytics. Second, the works in three key business application areas that are context-aware and/or exploit big data analytics have been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, the paper concludes by highlighting a number of contemporary research challenges, including issues concerning modelling, managing and applying business contexts to big data analytics. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2020","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","3387-3415","","9","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>cited By 5</p>","","","Big data; Advanced Analytics; Application programs; Business applications; Computational intelligence techniques; Context- awareness; Contextual information; Data Analytics; Economic situation; Intelligent computing; Potential benefits; Research challenges; Surveys; Workflow adaptations; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main contribution articulated in this paper is a process model that decomposes scholarly inquiries into four main activities: filter, extract, aggregate, and visualize. Based on the insight that these activities can be disaggregated across time, space, and tools, it is possible to generate derivative products, using our Archives Unleashed Toolkit, that serve as useful starting points for scholarly inquiry. Scholars can download these products from the Archives Unleashed Cloud and manipulate them just like any other dataset, thus providing access to web archives without requiring any specialized knowledge.

One interesting line of research focuses on the issue of dependency distance minimization. Studies have shown that dependency distance has been experiencing a process of minimization in order to adapt to the limited resource of human working memory. However, little is known of whether dependency distance also tends to minimize across a long span of time. If dependency distance tends to minimize, then it should be hypothesized that the minimization process may also occur across a long span of time. To this end, this study investigates the possible change of dependency distance in a diachronic dataset, i.e., the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2017. Results of the study confirm the hypothesis that dependency distance has been decreasing across the examined 200 years. Besides, the correlation of mean dependency distance and normalized dependency distance suggests that these two algorithms may serve well as measures of the same linguistic construct, i.e. syntactic complexity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","","","","239","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>cited By 11</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution is dependent on the stakeholders and interactions between them. The multidimensionality and context-dependency of causative factors make system thinking-based approach, namely network analysis, an effective tool to map the decision-making on countering child malnutrition. The study used Palghar district, India, as a case study to perform the stakeholder network analysis for identifying the various stakeholders who were targeted by actions and initiatives of district administration. The network analysis was performed for three temporal phases, namely Phase I (pre-2014), Phase II (years 2014–2017) and Phase III (2017 onwards). The study found that both network density of the system and child nutrition status have increased temporally. The study found an increase in network density due to an increase in the number of stakeholder groups targeted, implementation of new actions/initiatives and expansion of existing actions/initiatives to other stakeholders. A significant increase in focus towards the stakeholders influencing the socio-economic environment of the child is found in Phase III as compared to Phase II. Further, the study found that family and elite group have started featuring as prominent stakeholder targets for various actions. The study concludes that a greater incorporation of system-thinking approach in decision-making could help in effectively addressing child malnutrition and similar healthcare issues. © 2020 Association of Asia Scholars.","2020","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","79-98","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using examples from epigraphy and modern English literature, we discuss how the traditions of philology and textual scholarship shape our computational methodology, and how digital research has re-oriented traditional editorial workflows. Textual editing for digital publication encompasses not only the consensus of practitioners in philology, textual scholarship, and bibliography, but also the creation of a computational pipeline that curates the data and provides a structure for text analysis. Markup and text analysis can and should be treated as complementary activities planned together from the beginning of a project rather than as separate tasks. Digital text mining and analysis is already widely used for studying large data sets, but editing and text analysis of smaller sets of data can also create new avenues of scholarship.

In response, this study interrogates the smart city as global discourse network by examining a collection of key texts associated with cities worldwide. Using a list of 5,553 cities, a systematic webometric exercise was conducted to measure hit counts produced by searching for “smart city.” Consequently, 27 cities with the highest validated hit counts were selected. Next, 346 online texts were collected from among the top 20 hits across each of the selected cities, and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively using AntConc software. The findings confirm, first, the presence of a strong globalizing narrative which emphasizes world cities as “best practice” models. Second, they reveal the smart city’s association—beyond the quest for incremental, technical improvements of current urban systems and processes—with a pronounced transformative governance agenda. The article identifies five critical junctures at the heart of the evolving smart city discourse regime; these shed light on the ongoing boundary work in which the smart city is engaged and which contain significant unresolved tensions.

By leveraging statistical and predictive analyses, we furnish empirical evidence to demonstrate a reliable relationship between our proposed measure and review helpfulness. Our findings suggest that topic diversity is another measure to estimate reviews’ conveying information along with the number of words. This study contributes to academia and industry, respectively.

Sentiment analysis helps to understand and evaluate public opinion regarding social events, product services, and political trends, especially the feelings expressed through comments by users in social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. There have been a lot of research attempts to address the tweets sentiment analysis problem with high accuracy, particularly in case of tweets that express a single sentiment towards a single object. However, the results of the classification are not highly accurate in cases such as the following: a user expresses multiple sentiments towards a single object in a tweet; a user presents multiple sentiments towards multiple objects; and a user indicates a single sentiment towards multiple objects. Furthermore, the previous studies only analyze the sentiment of each tweet without considering the objects and the sentiment towards each object from an entire set of tweets. This study attempts to deal with the limitations of the previous methods; an approach is proposed herein, based on integrating the sentiment towards a particular object from all tweets related to that object. The proposed method focuses on determining the objects and indicating the sentiment towards the specific objects by combining the sentiments related to each object from the entire set of tweets. On experimental evaluation, the proposed method is observed to have achieved a fairly good result in terms of the error ratio and achieved information. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Examples of such relations include 'next to', 'overlapping', 'to the left of', 'separate from', 'including', and so on. These relations occur within the data found in the spatial humanities, but the computational techniques described here do not appear to have been used in connection with this context. While Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are widely used as a means of visualizing and exploring material in the spatial humanities, GIS technology is acknowledged to be ill-suited to information that is vague, uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise or having other qualities that in a scientific setting could be regarded as imperfections. In the humanities such 'imperfections' are of course important, and qualitative spatial relations are one source of data that challenges scientifically based GIS. This article reviews the origin of qualitative spatial reasoning and representation in A. N. Whitehead's mereotopology and argues for exploring how these methods could complement GIS as a computational technique in the humanities. Qualitative representation is applicable to modelling spatial arrangements in many domains, not just geographical space. This is demonstrated through an example of spatial relations in lines of printed text. © Edinburgh University Press 2019","2019","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","2-27","","1-2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Edinburgh University Press","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More people are using cloud services to store and share files from wherever there is the Internet. As more users are embracing the flexibility associated with the cloud, digital devices are becoming pertinent to criminal investigations or civil litigations. The analysis of a case now involves several seized devices, each with a different platform. The result is an increased volume of digital evidence coupled with a lack of standardized techniques to examine and analyze this evidence. Existing forensic tools do not provide automation of analysis but are designed to find fragments of evidence. As a result, these tools do not assist in the investigations. Law enforcement throughout the world is encountering substantial digital evidence backlogs. We propose the development of an open-source client forensic artifacts knowledgebase that uses Neo4j as the graph database. The database contains the cloud storage service, the platform used for interaction, the description of the created artifacts and the activity that generated the artifact. An artifact refers to a “thing” that is produced by users during an interaction, for example, a registry key created by the installation of a storage service. The knowledgebase contributes to addressing the volume problem by allowing for the location of evidential artifacts promptly, enabling forensic investigators to string together the different clues and user cloud interactions for a better understanding of the user actions and attribution. Also, this will help the investigator finish the forensic task more efficiently and address critical judicial questions without being overwhelmed by the amount of data. The paper describes cloud computing technologies relevant to investigations, the research in progress, the rationale for choosing this database, the building of the initial data set from artifacts identified from the current research, and the design and implementation of the database. The paper concludes by describing the relevance and importance of such a tool to investigators and future work. © 2019 14th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2019.

He argued first that there would be problems in objectively determining novelty. Second, even if we could obtain such a measure, it was not clear to Harrington how it could be used. Third, Harrington also raised several broader problems that he saw arising from the IN definition. In this commentary, I respond to each of those criticisms, showing that they are not the problems that Harrington believed that they were, and that the IN definition can serve its proposed function. Also, Harrington did not address what I raised as a critically important problem arising from any definition that uses value as a criterion: a person’s creativity changing after death.

Traditional survey methods would have accomplished this study, but they are too costly in terms of resources needed, and they are subject to social desirability bias for topics discovery. Hence, there is a need to use alternative efficient means such as Twitter data and machine learning (ML) techniques. Objective: Using Twitter data, the aim of the study was to (1) provide a methodological extension for efficiently extracting widely consumed drugs during seasonal influenza and (2) extract topics from the tweets of these drugs and to infer how the insights provided by these topics can enhance seasonal influenza surveillance. Methods: From tweets collected during the 2012-13 flu season, we first identified tweets with mentions of drugs and then constructed an ML classifier using dependency words as features. The classifier was used to extract tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs, out of which we identified the mostly consumed drugs. Finally, we extracted trending topics from each of these widely used drugs’ tweets using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Results: Our proposed classifier obtained an F1 score of 0.82, which significantly outperformed the two benchmark classifiers (ie, P&lt;.001 with the lexicon-based and P=.048 with the 1-gram term frequency [TF]). The classifier extracted 40,428 tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs out of 50,828 tweets with mentions of drugs. The most widely consumed drugs were influenza virus vaccines that had around 76.95% (31,111/40,428) share of the total; other notable drugs were Theraflu, DayQuil, NyQuil, vitamins, acetaminophen, and oseltamivir. The topics of each of these drugs exhibited common themes or experiences from people who have consumed these drugs. Among these were the enabling and deterrent factors to influenza drugs uptake, which are keys to mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. Conclusions: The study results showed the feasibility of using tweets of widely consumed drugs to enhance seasonal influenza surveillance in lieu of the traditional or conventional surveillance approaches. Public health officials and other stakeholders can benefit from the findings of this study, especially in enhancing strategies for mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks. The proposed methods can be extended to the outbreaks of other diseases. ©Ireneus Kagashe, Zhijun Yan, Imran Suheryani.","2017","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","","","9","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 40</p>","","","machine learning; social media; Humans; Social Media; human; Disease Outbreaks; drug therapy; Drug Therapy; epidemic; influenza; Influenza; Machine Learning; procedures; public health; Public Health; statistics and numerical data; utilization; Human; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we proposed a new method that combines the opining mining and context-based topic modelling to analyse public opinions on social media data. Context based topic modelling is used to categorise data in groups and discover hidden communities in data group. The unwanted data group discovered by the topic model then will be discarded. A lexicon based opinion mining method will be applied to the remaining data groups to spot out the public sentiment about the entities. A set of Tweets data on Australian Federal Election 2010 was used in our experiments.

The increased use of digital tools and methods for archaeological research and dissemination, as well as what Roosevelt (2015) has referred to as the shift to the digital paradigm within archaeological practice, leads us to suggest that the impact of this paradigm shift requires careful and critical examination. This article will examine the edges of the disciplines of archaeology and sociology, where we aim to advance our understanding of the relationship between digital technologies and archaeological knowledge from a uniquely social perspective, using the theoretical approaches of both classic and modern sociologists. The application of this lens of sociology to digital archaeology equips us to understand how archaeology and archaeological practice is situated in a social world, which is especially relevant in the Global West, where digital technology is ubiquitous. Through a critical consideration of the complexity of use of digital technologies within digital archaeology, we can begin to shift our focus away from the character and method of tools and workflow, to the background of intellectual power and influence. © 2017 Lorna-Jane Richardson, Simon Lindgren, published by De Gruyter Open.","2017","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","139-148","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: De Gruyter Open Ltd","<p>cited By 13</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationship of digital history to the old ""New Economic History"" (Cliometrics) is considered. The question of whether digital history and traditional history need be at odds or, instead, might complement each other is woven throughout. The rapidly expanding territory of digital humanistic research outside of psychology is briefly discussed. Finally, the challenging current employment trends in history and the humanities more broadly are considered, along with the role that digital skills might play in mitigating those factors for prospective academic workers. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","2016","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","209-219","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: American Psychological Association Inc.","<p>cited By 14</p>","","","history; Historiography; Digital; Libraries; library; psychology; Psychology; standards; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a matter of fact, thanks to an unprecedented amount of digitization projects and to the preservation of born-digital sources, for the first time they have at their disposal a gigantic collection of traces of our past. However, to understand trends and obtain useful insights from these very large amounts of data, historians will need more and more fine-grained techniques. This will be especially true if their objective will turn to hypothesis-testing studies, in order to build arguments by employing their deep in-domain expertise. For this reason, we focus our paper on a set of computational techniques, namely semi-supervised computational methods, which could potentially provide us with a methodological turning point for this change. As a matter of fact these approaches, due to their potential of affirming themselves as both knowledge and data driven at the same time, could become a solid alternative to some of the today most employed unsupervised techniques. However, historians who intend to employ them as evidences for supporting a claim, have to use computational methods not anymore as black boxes but as a series of well known methodological approaches. For this reason, we believe that if developing computational skills will be important for them, a solid background knowledge on the most important data analysis and results evaluation procedures will become far more capital. © Edinburgh University Press 2016","2016","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","63-77","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Edinburgh University Press","<p>cited By 5</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of us have ancestors and relatives who participated in the war, and in the worst case got killed. Researchers are eager to find out what actually happened then, and even more importantly why, so that future wars could perhaps be prevented. The darkest data of war history are casualty records-from such data we could perhaps learn most about the war. This paper presents a model and system for representing death records as linked data, so that 1) citizens could find out more easily what happened to their relatives during WW2 and 2) digital humanities (DH) researchers could (re)use the data easily for research.","2016","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","3-14","","","1608","","","","","","","","CEUR-WS","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 16130073","<p>cited By 3; Conference of 1st Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic Web, WHiSe 2016 ; Conference Date: 29 May 2016; Conference Code:122265</p>","","","Digital humanities; Semantic Web; Linked datum; Linked open datum; Military operations; Second World War; PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","Isaksen L., Daga E., Adamou A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This pioneering book describes and demonstrates the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for research and in teaching and learning. It helps humanities scholars to grasp Big Data in order to do their work, whether that means understanding the underlying algorithms at work in search engines, or designing and using their own tools to process large amounts of information. Demonstrating what digital tools have to offer and also what ‘digital’ does to how we understand the past, the authors introduce the many different tools and developing approaches in Big Data for historical and humanistic scholarship, show how to use them, what to be wary of, and discuss the kinds of questions and new perspectives this new macroscopic perspective opens up. Authored ‘live’ online with ongoing feedback from the wider digital history community, Exploring Big Historical Data breaks new ground and sets the direction for the conversation into the future. It represents the current state-of-the-art thinking in the field and exemplifies the way that digital work can enhance public engagement in the humanities. Exploring Big Historical Data should be the go-to resource for undergraduate and graduate students confronted by a vast corpus of data, and researchers encountering these methods for the first time. It will also offer a helping hand to the interested individual seeking to make sense of genealogical data or digitized newspapers, and even the local historical society who are trying to see the value in digitizing their holdings. The companion website to Exploring Big Historical Data can be found at http://www.themacroscope.org/.

Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future – or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline. © 2014 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.","2014","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","861-870","","6","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two interfaces we designed, the Danish Folklore Nexus (DFL 1.0) and ETKSpace (DFL 2.0), represent differing approaches to the challenges inherent in curating a large collection of non-digital materials for online presentation and designing a digital environment that enables folklore scholars to access and explore the collection in a straightforward and intellectually enlightening manner. Among these challenges are those related to the bulk digitization of archival assets, the storage of those assets in a secure and persistent manner, and the selection of appropriate presentation technologies, database structures, and metadata formats. Predicated on the idea of fusing “distant reading” (Moretti 2000) to “close reading,” the Danish Folklore Nexus provides one possible solution to the pressing need for simple yet robust methods for navigating a folklore collection along multiple axes of introspection. We also present our work on ETKSpace (DFL 2.0), an online portal to the entire corpus (approximately three thousand informants, twelve thousand place names, and sixty thousand records) that incorporates a faceted browsing interface similar to an online shopping site, allowing researchers to rapidly delimit and export research corpora for more detailed types of analysis. Our discussion presents “lessons learned” as well as considerations of possible future directions for this type of digital archival scholarship. © 2014 Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Indiana University.","2014","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","223-247","","2","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Indiana University","<p>cited By 6</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some cases, such as Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, the sheer scope of the available material will require the use of sophisticated mining, machine learning, and visualization. Some subjects, such as zero day exploits, botnets, wiretapping, the deep Web, will present challenges both in terms of access and the degree of technical expertise required to assess them.

Stanley Hall. Using the methods of the increasingly popular digital humanities, some key attributes of the American Journal of Psychology (AJP) and the Pedagogical Seminary (PS) are identified. Our analysis reaffirms some of Hall's explicit aims for the two periodicals, while also revealing a number of other features of the journals, as well as of the people who published within their pages, the methodologies they employed, and the institutions at which they worked. Notably, despite Hall's intent that his psychological journal be strictly an outlet for scientific research, the journal-like its sister pedagogically focused publication-included an array of methodologically diverse research. The multiplicity of research styles that characterize the content of Hall's journals in their initial years is, in part, a consequence of individual researchers at times crossing methodological lines and producing a diverse body of research. Along with such variety within each periodical, it is evident that the line between content appropriate to one periodical rather than the other was fluid rather than absolute. The full results of this digitally informed analysis of Hall's two journals suggest a number of novel avenues for future research and demonstrate the utility of digital methods as applied to the history of psychology. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","2013","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","249-268","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 15</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This introduction is concerned with the changing practice of 'doing' history in the digital age, seen within a broader historical context of developments in the digital humanities and 'digital history'. It argues that there is too much emphasis on tools and data while too little attention is being paid to how doing history in the digital age is changing as a result of the digital turn. This tendency towards technological determinism needs to be balanced by more attention to methodological and epistemological considerations. The article offers a short survey of history and computing since the 1960s with particular attention given to the situation in the Netherlands, considers various definitions of 'digital history' and argues for an integrative view of historical practice in the digital age that underscores hybridity as its main characteristic. It then discusses some of the major changes in historical practice before outlining the three major themes that are explored by the various articles in this thematic issue - digitisation and the archive, digital historical analysis, and historical knowledge (re)presentation and audiences.","2013","2022-09-01 12:59:45","2022-09-01 13:13:37","","3-29","","4","128","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Koninklijk Nederlands Historisch Genootschap","<p>cited By 36</p>","","","PH in reference; Search Method - Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A versão em francês possui link para a equipe editorial, e a versão espanhola possui links para a equipe editorial, e os exemplos das urls de para visualização das propostas tanto de novas quanto de traduções.</p> <p>Em relação à estrutura do ficheiro, não há necessidade de existir um ficheiro `<code>licoes`</code> e dentro dele a estrutura de originais, publicadas e traduções, pq esse já é um ficheiro para lições. Além disso, há um ficheiro README.md tanto no ficheiro pt quanto no ficheiro pt/licoes com as mesmas informações. Entretanto o ficheiro em pt/licoes possui link para a equipe de editores.</p> <p>As estruturas nos outros 3 idiomas está incoerente.
